This Python module contains several scripts that accompany the following submitted paper:

Van Noten, K., Lecocq, T., Goffin, C., Meyvis, B., Molron, J., Debacker, T. & Devleeschouwer, X. submitted. Brusselsâ€™ bedrock paleorelief from borehole-controlled powerlaws linking polarised H/V resonance frequencies and sediment thickness. Journal of Seismology.

Don't hesitate to cite this source :-)
The purpose of the codes are to convert data output files of GEOPSY (http://www.geopsy.org/) into more practical figures ready for scientific publishing. 

Enjoy !

## 1. Create .hv files in Geopsy
Conduct H/V spectral ratio analyses from gathered ambient noise measurements in Geopsy and save the output of Geopsy as .hv file.

Do that xxx times for the entire database and update your database file (see HVSR database.csv) with the necessary information (ID, Filename, altitude of measurements, ...)

## 2. Get f0s from geopsy hv files.py
This script loads all HVSR data (min f0, f0, max f0, error, max Amplitude, n of windows) automatically from all .hv files listed in the database file. The default setting of Geopsy to export the H/V spectrum is set to 100 samples (100 freq. and Amplitude values), no matter the range in the output frequency sampling. If this default sampling setting is used, a wide output range, e.g. 0.5 Hz to 50 Hz, will pick f0 less accurately than if a narrow range around the peak amplitude is selected. To increase the f0 picking accuracy, one can increase the sample setting to the maximum (e.g. 9999 samples in Geospy) in Geopsy. Or one can resample the Geopsy output curve by a performing a linear interpolation up to 15000 samples (interpolation used in this script). This results in a slightly different interpolated amplitude maximum and f0 than the one exported by Geopsy. The interpolated values (f0_ip & A0)and its difference with F0 from Geopsy (f0_ip_diff) will be exported to the database file.

## 3. HVSR to virtual borehole.py: 
This script replots one or all .hv files into a f0 versus amplitude plot and to convert the H/V spectrum to a VIRTUAL BOREHOLE using either a regression - powerlaw - function between f0 and depth. See Van Noten et al. (submitted) for explanation of the methodology. The figure in below shows the output of the script:

## 4. HVSR polarisation.py:
The H/V rotational module in Geopsy computes the azimuth in which the resonance frequency has a maximum amplitude. To facilate reading this polarisation, this python script plots the variation of the amplitude with azimuth in a polar plot. The IDs to plot will be loaded from the HVSR database file. Polarisation data (Amax, Amin and their corresponding azimuths and frequencues) will be exported to a separate file which then can be visualised in a GIS. Output figure:

## 5. Construct the f0 - Sed Thickness Powerlaw Relation.ipynb:
Ipython notebook to construct figures 5,6,7 and 8 in the paper. This notebook reads the supplementary data of the paper: 
VanNotenetal_JOSE_S1 - Borehole HVSR analysis.csv : Borehole data and picked resonance frequency data
VanNotenetal_JOSE_S2 - Survey HVSR analysis.csv: Survey HVSR data and picked resonance frequency data

## Installation
To run the steps above, you need:

- Python (3.x recommended)
- Iptyhon notebook
- Numpy
- Scipy
- Pandas
- MatPlotLib
- csv
