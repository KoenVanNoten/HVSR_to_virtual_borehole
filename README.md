# HVSR_to_virtual_borehole

# Purpose 

1. Perform H/V spectral ratio analysis from ambient noise analysis in Geopsy
2. Save H/V analysis in Geopsy as .hv
3. Do that xxx times for the entire database
4. Load all HVSR data (min f0, f0, max f0, error, max Amplitude, n of windows) automatically from the entire campaign from all .hv files using # f0_from_HV.py
5. Replot one or all .hv files into a f0 versus amplitude plot + convert the H/V spectrum to a VIRTUAL BOREHOLE with either one Vs value or with regression function between f0 and depth
